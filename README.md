# BINF*6210 Assignment 3 - Trait Evolution

This assignment aimed to create a phylogenetic tree to show the relation between species within the hummingbird genus, Phaethornis. Trait data to represent body size (tarsus length) as well as each species' IUCN Red List status was mapped onto this tree to test the hypothesis that species with larger body sizes within a taxon are at a greater risk of extinction.

Some suggestions for edits:
- Make filtering step for sequences prior to alignment more logical
- Consider use of other models for clustering and tree building
- Use a distance matrix to determine most representative sequence from each species instead of random sampling
